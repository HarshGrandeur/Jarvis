I'd rather avoid the kind of thing which ends up being pretty religious with relatively little basis (e.g. brace placing) but examples might include things like \"unit testing isn't actually terribly helpful\" or \"public fields are okay really\". The important thing (to me, anyway) is that you've got reasons behind your opinions.\n",

If both peaks are \"sharp\" -- i.e. short in time duration -- when looking at the signal in the frequency domain (by doing FFT) you\\'ll get energy at most bands. But if the \"good\" peak reliably has energy present at frequencies not existing in the \"bad\" peak, or vice versa, you may be able to automatically differentiate them that way.\\n', 'There are lots and lots of classic peak detection methods, any of which might work.  You\\'ll have to see what, in particular, bounds the quality of your data.  Here are basic descriptions:\\n\\n\\nBetween any two points in your data, (x(0),y(0)) and (x(n),y(n)), add up y(i+1)-y(i) for 0 &lt;= i &lt; n and call this T (\"travel\") and set R (\"rise\") to y(n)- y(0) + k for suitably small k.  T/R > 1 indicates a peak.  This works OK if large travel due to noise is unlikely or if noise distributes symmetrically around a base curve shape.  For your application, accept the earliest peak with a score above a given threshold, or analyze the curve of travel per rise values for more interesting properties.\\nUse matched filters to score similarity to a standard peak shape (essentially, use a normalized dot-product against some shape to get a cosine-metric of similarity)\\nDeconvolve against a standard peak shape and check for high values (though I often find 2 to be less sensitive to noise for simple instrumentation output).\\nSmooth the data and check for triplets of equally spaced points where, if x0 &lt; x1 &lt; x2, y1 > 0.5*(y0+y2), or check Euclidean distances like this:  D((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) + D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) > D((x0,y0),(x2,y2)), which relies on the triangle inequality.  Using simple ratios will again provide you a scoring mechanism.\\nFit a very simple 2-gaussian mixture model to your data (for example, Numerical Recipes has a nice ready-made chunk of code).  Take the earlier peak.  This will deal correctly with overlapping peaks.\\nFind the best match in the data to a simple Gaussian, Cauchy, Poisson, or what-have-you curve.  Evaluate this curve over a broad range and subtract it from a copy of the data after noting it\\'s peak location.  Repeat.  Take the earliest peak whose model parameters (standard deviation probably, but some applications might care about kurtosis or other features) meet some criterion.  Watch out for artifacts left behind when peaks are subtracted from the data.\\nBest match might be determined by the kind of match scoring suggested in #2 above.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve done what you\\'re doing before:  finding peaks in DNA sequence data, finding peaks in derivatives estimated from measured curves, and finding peaks in histograms.\\n\\nI encourage you to attend carefully to proper baselining.  Wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise.\\n\\nFinally, if your data is typically noisy and you\\'re getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output (or even referenced, just not differential), and if you\\'re averaging lots of observations into each data point, try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains.  There are a host of such outlier elimination tactics that can be really useful.\\n', \"I would like to contribute to this thread an algorithm that I have developed myself:\\n\\nThis algorithm signals when the data points are a specified number of standard deviations away from the moving mean. However, when a signal is detected, subsequent data points that are also a signal (so significantly away from the moving mean), will not corrupt the signal threshold. That is, the algorithm creates a  'new mean' and 'new st.dev.' in which the data points that are signals are not used. Therefore, the threshold remains uncorrupted and is able to correctly identify future signals too, without loss of performance. This works extremely well!\\n\\nIn order to display the power of this robust algorithm, I have prepared a demo in which the user can specify its own data.

I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the \"Finding Duplicated Code\" link on the PMD web page.\\n\\nI\\'d like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their \"out-of-the-box\" set of rules. And not just because they\\'re open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or \"hooks\" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the \"designer\" tool that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the DescendantToken check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.\\n\\nI integrate these tools with an Ant-based build. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.\\n\\nIn addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat \"integrated\" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I\\'d like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the \"static-analysis\" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a \"unified\" solution? (I\\'ve asked this question separately here)\\n\\nFirst, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:\\n\\n/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message\\n\\nThis is often called the \"Emacs format,\" but even if you aren\\'t using Emacs, it\\'s a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:\\n\\n/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.\\n\\nMy warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant filterchains.\\n\\nThe second \"integration\" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you\\'re suppressing a warning, you\\'re suppressing a warning, so why not always write \"SuppressWarning?\"\\n\\nFor example, PMD\\'s default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string \"NOPMD\" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java\\'s @SuppressWarnings annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing \"SuppressWarning(PMD.\" instead of NOPMD so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:\\n\\n// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained\\n\\nOnly the \"SuppressWarnings(PMD.\" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD\\'s support for the @SuppressWarning annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:\\n\\n@SuppressWarnings(\"PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals\") // justification: identity comparision intended\\n\\nSimilarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings CHECKSTYLE:OFF and CHECKSTYLE:ON, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle\\'s \"SuppressionCommentFilter\") to use the strings \"BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.\" and \"END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.\" makes the controls look more like PMD:\\n\\n\\n// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: \"Effective Java,\" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2\\n// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)\\n\\n\\nWith Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (HiddenField) is significant because each check has its own \"BEGIN/END\" comment pair.\\n\\nFindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a @SuppressWarnings annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom @SuppressWarnings annotation because the built-in Java @SuppressWarnings annotation has a SOURCE retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java\\'s @SuppressWarnings annotation:\\n\\n@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(\"UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR\")\\n\\nThese techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string \"SuppressWarnings\" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.\\n', \"I've had good luck with Cobertura.

If you are primarily inserting 1000 rows a second and not doing any querying, then a clustered index is a hit to performance.  If you are doing 1000 queries a second, then not having an index will lead to very bad performance.  The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server.  This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Edit]\\r\\n@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  For example, there is an issue known as a \"hotspot\", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table\\'s data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  If you even think you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by this server, but all values generated by all computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record\\'s permanent key value at the time the record is created. \\r\\n  \\r\\n  http://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspx\\r\\n', \"The primary key serves three purposes:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nindicates that the column(s) should be unique\\r\\nindicates that the column(s) should be non-null\\r\\ndocument the intent that this is the unique identifier of the row\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first two can be specified in lots of ways, as you have already done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third reason is good:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfor humans, so they can easily see your intent\\r\\nfor the computer, so a program that might compare or otherwise process your table can query the database for the table's primary key.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA primary key doesn't have to be an auto-incrementing number field, so I would say that it's a good idea to specify your guid column as the primary key.\", \"A Primary Key needn't be an autoincrementing field, in many cases this just means you are complicating your table structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, a Primary Key should be the minimum collection of attributes (note that most DBMS will allow a composite primary key) that uniquely identifies a tuple.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn technical terms, it should be the field that every other field in the tuple is fully functionally dependent upon.

So in the results from your statement \"repcount\" is 1 in each row.\\n\\n@yukondude, Your step 4 is the heart of my question.\\n', 'I\\'ve had to do this before. The only real way to do it is to manually match up the various locations. Use your database\\'s console interface and grouping select statements. First, add your \"Company Name\" field.

WHERE \"Location Name\" = \"The Location\" statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. - You should really break your company names and location names out into separate tables and refer to them by their primary keys.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdate: - Wow - no duplicates?

You can use regular expressions for this. Store this list in a separate table.\\r\\nSort that list alphabetically and (manually) determine which entries should be CompanyNames.\\r\\nCompare each CompanyName to each LocationName and come up with a match score (use Levenshtein or some other string matching algo).

That would avoid a fair bit of text duplication in this table (over 18,000 rows, an integer foreign key would save quite a bit of space over a varchar column).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you\\'re still faced with a method for loading that Company table and then properly associating it with the rows in Location. There\\'s no general solution, but you could do something along these lines:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCreate the Company table, with an id column that auto-increments (depends on your RDBMS).\\r\\nFind all of the unique company names and insert them into Company.\\r\\nAdd a column, company_id, to Location that accepts NULLs (for now) and that is a foreign key of the Company.id column.\\r\\nFor each row in Location, determine the corresponding company, and UPDATE that row\\'s company_id column with that company\\'s id. This is likely the most challenging step. If your data is like what you show in the example, you\\'ll likely have to take many runs at this with various string matching approaches.\\r\\nOnce all rows in Location have a company_id value, then you can ALTER the Company table to add a NOT NULL constraint to the company_id column (assuming that every location must have a company, which seems reasonable).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can make a copy of your Location table, you can gradually build up a series of SQL statements to populate the company_id foreign key. If you make a mistake, you can just start over and rerun the script up to the point of failure.', \"Yes, that step 4 from my previous post is a doozy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter what, you're probably going to have to do some of this by hand, but you may be able to automate the bulk of it. For the example locations you gave, a query like the following would set the appropriate company_id value:\\r\\n\\r\\nUPDATE  LocationSET     Company_ID = 1WHERE   (LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE '%to_n shop%'OR      LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE '%tts%')AND     Company_ID IS NULL;\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that would match your examples (I added the IS NULL part to not overwrite previously set Company_ID values), but of course in 18,000 rows you're going to have to be pretty inventive to handle the various combinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething else that might help would be to use the names in Company to generate queries like the one above. You could do something like the following (in MySQL):\\r\\n\\r\\nSELECT  CONCAT('UPDATE Location SET Company_ID = ',        Company_ID, ' WHERE LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE ',        LOWER(REPLACE(Company_Name), ' ', '%'), ' AND Company_ID IS NULL;')FROM    Company;\\r\\n\\r\\nThen just run the statements that it produces.

Look at the error message.  Note that it expected some MD5 hashes, but instead got back 'null'.

The fact that you have a 'null' implies that something else is wrong.\\n\\nI have two theories:\\n\\n\\nBug in SVN.\\nSomething had an exclusive lock on the file, and the MD5 couldn't happen.\\n\\n\\nIn the case of #1, try upgrading to the latest SVN version.  Maybe also post this on the svn-devel mailing list (http://svn.haxx.se), so the developers can see it.\\n\\nIn the case of #2, check to see if anything has the file locked.

Ie, just have the IDE open as you're developing and write your test as you go to cut down on your dev time.

You can't really think of them as unit-tests along the lines of an xUnit framework, but they are tests targetted to very specific functionality.

Then make one or more Interfaces that the writer must implement for your code to know when and where to execute the code.  \\nMake an API the writer can use to access some of the functionality in your code.  \\n\\n\\nYou could also make a base class the writer must inherit. This will make wiring up the API easier. Then use some kind of reflection to scan a directory, and load the classes you find that matches your requirements.  \\n\\nSome people also make a scripting language for their system, or implements an interpreter for a subset of an existing language. This is also a possible route to go.\\n\\nBottom line is: When you get the code to load, only your imagination should be able to stop you.\\nGood luck.\\n', \"This is generally something thatÂ\\xa0you'll have to expose yourself, so yes, it will be dependent on the language your system is written in (though often it's possible to write wrappers for other languages as well).\\n\\nIf, for example, you had a program written in C, for Windows, plugins would be written for your program as DLLs.  At runtime, you would manually load these DLLs, and expose some interface to them.  For example, the DLLs might expose a gimme_the_interface() function which could accept a structure filled with function pointers.  These function pointers would allow the DLL to make calls, register callbacks, etc.\\n\\nIf you were in C++, you would use the DLL system, except you would probably pass an object pointer instead of a struct, and the object would implement an interface which provided functionality (accomplishing the same thing as the struct, but less ugly).  For Java, you would load class files on-demand instead of DLLs, but the basic idea would be the same.\\n\\nIn all cases, you'll need to define a standard interface between your code and the plugins, so that you can initialize the plugins, and so the plugins can interact with you.\\n\\nP.S. If you'd like to see a good example of a C++ plugin system, check out the foobar2000 SDK.  I haven't used it in quite a while, but it used to be really well done.

You can insert hooks for plugins by dispatching events and providing access to the application state.\\n\\nFor example, if you were writing a blogging application, you might want to raise an event just before a new post is saved to the database, and provide the post HTML to the plugin to alter as needed.\\n\", \"I'm tempted to point you to the Design Patterns book for this generic question :p\\n\\nSeriously, I think the answer is no. You can't write extensible code by default, it will be both hard to write/extend and awfully inefficient (Mozilla started with the idea of being very extensible, used XPCOM everywhere, and now they realized it was a mistake and started to remove it where it doesn't make sense).\\n\\nwhat makes sense to do is to identify the pieces of your system that can be meaningfully extended and support a proper API for these cases (e.g. language support plug-ins in an editor). You'd use the relevant patterns, but the specific implementation depends on your platform/language choice.\\n\\nIMO, it also helps to use a dynamic language - makes it possible to tweak the core code at run time (when absolutely necessary).

Both Python and Lua are excellent languages that are used to script a large number of applications (Civ4 and blender use Python, Supreme Commander uses Lua, etc).  \\n\\nIf you are using C++, check out the boost python library.  Otherwise, python ships with headers that can be used in C, and does a fairly good job documenting the C/python API.  The documentation seemed less complete for Lua, but I may not have been looking hard enough.  Either way, you can offer a fairly solid scripting platform without a terrible amount of work.

The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. \\n\\nThis great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.\\n\\nBut here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. \\n\\nBecause of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data.

But the kicker is, you can also make a class that takes f.x. a ICreateRepository in its constructor, so the code will end up being very easy to do some really funky stuff with. There are also interfaces for the Services in the business tier here.\\nAt last i stick all the domain objects into the extra assembly, just to make the code base itself a bit cleaner and more loosely coupled.

It sends the item (or business object) to the service in the Business Tier. The business tier validates the object, and if it is OK, it sends it to the data tier for storage.\\n\\nThe UI knows the service in the business tier which again knows about the data tier.\\n\\nThe UI is responsible for mapping the users data input to and from the objects, and the data tier is responsible for mapping the data in the db to and from the objects.

If I'm understanding your problem correctly, it sounds like you're trying to satisfy too much with a single interface, and that's just causing it to become cluttered.  Why not have two interfaces into the business layer?  One would be a simple, safe interface for the UI layer.  The other would be a lower-level interface for the data layer.\\n\\nYou can apply this two-interface approach to any objects which need to be passed to both the UI and the data layers, too.\\n\\npublic class BusinessLayer : ISimpleBusiness\\n{}\\n\\npublic class Some3LayerObject : ISimpleSome3LayerObject\\n{}\\n\\n\", 'You may want to split your interfaces into two types, namely:\\n\\n\\nView interfaces -- which are interfaces that specify your interactions with your UI, and\\nData interfaces -- which are interfaces that will allow you to specify interactions with your data\\n\\n\\nIt is possible to inherit and implement both set of interfaces such that:\\n\\npublic class BusinessObject : IView, IData\\n\\n\\nThis way, in your data layer you only need to see the interface implementation of IData, while in your UI you only need to see the interface implementation of IView.\\n\\nAnother strategy you might want to use is to compose your objects in the UI or Data layers such that they are merely consumed by these layers, e.g.,\\n\\npublic class BusinessObject : DomainObject\\n\\npublic class ViewManager&lt;T&gt; where T : DomainObject\\n\\npublic class DataManager&lt;T&gt; where T : DomainObject\\n\\n\\nThis in turn allows your business object to remain ignorant of both the UI/View layer and the data layer.\\n', 'If I understand the question correctly, you\\'ve created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you\\'re concerned about polluting your domain model with the \\'plumbing\\' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object\\'s fields.\\n\\nTaking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.\\nThe first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.\\n\\nE.g\\n\\npublic class User\\n{\\n\\tprivate string name;\\n\\tprivate AccountStatus status;\\n\\n\\tprivate User()\\n\\t{\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tpublic string Name\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tget { return name; }\\n\\t\\tset { name = value; }\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tpublic AccountStatus Status\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tget { return status; }\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tpublic void Activate()\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tstatus = AccountStatus.Active;\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tpublic void Suspend()\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tstatus = AccountStatus.Suspended;\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tpublic static User GetById(int id)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tUser fetchedUser = new User();\\n\\n\\t\\t// Lots of database and error-checking code\\n\\t\\t// omitted for clarity\\n\\t\\t// ...\\n\\n\\t\\tfetchedUser.name = (string) reader[\"Name\"];\\n\\t\\tfetchedUser.status = (int)reader[\"statusCode\"] == 0 ?

We don\\'t want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don\\'t have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object\\'s name and status fields.\\n\\nThe second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:\\n  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object\\'s private parts)\\n  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word \\'Private\\') and hope no one uses them accidentally\\n  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++\\n\\nFor more information, I\\'d recommend Martin Fowler\\'s classic book \\'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture\\'\\n\\nHowever, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I\\'d strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft\\'s Entity Framework. I\\'ve worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value.

Too much effort is being put into the \"impedence mismatch\" between object and relational models.  Here\\'s an idea: stop trying.\\n\\nWrite stored procedures to encapsulate your data.  Use results sets, DataSet, DataTable, SqlCommand (or the java/php/whatever equivalent) as needed from code to interact with the database.  You don\\'t need those objects.

You have to keep things as simple as possible, or you will have an absolutely un-maintainable system.

The only difference between the two code snippets is the source of the first move instruction, and both are offsets relative to ds, implying that both refer to baked-in constants.\\nTesting for equality against the empty string, as either a literal or the string.Empty property, sets up a two-argument function call, which indicates inequality by returning zero. I base this conclusion on other tests that I performed a couple of months ago, in which I followed some of my own code across the managed/unmanaged divide and back. In all cases, any call that required two or more arguments put the first argument in register ECX, and and the second in register EDX. I don\\'t recall how subsequent arguments were passed. Nevertheless, the call setup looked more like __fastcall than __stdcall. Likewise, the expected return values always showed up in register EAX, which is almost universal.\\nTesting the length of the string sets up a one-argument function call, which returns 1 (in register EAX), which happens to be the length of the string being tested.\\nGiven that the immediately visible machine code is almost identical, the only reason that I can imagine that would account for the better performance of the string equality over the sting length reported by Shinny is that the two-argument function that performs the comparison is significantly better optimized than the one-argument function that reads the length off the string instance.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAs a matter of principle, I avoid comparing against the empty string as a literal, because the empty string literal can appear ambiguous in source code. To that end, my .NET helper classes have long defined the empty string as a constant. Though I use string.Empty for direct, inline comparisons, the constant earns its keep for defining other constants whose value is the empty string, because a constant cannot be assigned string.Empty as its value.\\n\\nThis exercise settles, once and for all, any concern I might have about the cost, if any, of comparing against either string.Empty or the constant defined by my helper classes.\\n\\nHowever, it also raises a puzzling question to replace it; why is comparing against string.Empty more efficient than testing the length of the string? Or is the test used by Shinny invalidated because by the way the loop is implemented? (I find that hard to believe, but, then again, I\\'ve been fooled before, as I\\'m sure you have, too!)\\n\\nI have long assumed that system.string objects were counted strings, fundamentally similar to the long established Basic String (BSTR) that we have long known from COM.\\n']]}\n"
